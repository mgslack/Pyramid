    <p>Pyramid is a simple but hard game that uses 'checkers' in a pyramid shaped board.  The goal of the game
	   is to remove all but one of the checkers from the board by jumping neighboring checkers.  Can only
	   jump neighboring checkers that are diagonal or horizontal to the checker moving.  To move a checker
	   piece to jump another, drag the image with the mouse to an empty square.  If you can do the jump to that
	   square, the checker will be allowed to drop.</p>
    <p>If you cannot make any additional moves, the game will inform you that there are no more moves that
	   can be made and ask if you want to undo the last move to try again, or end the current game.  If you
	   answer yes, you are put back in the game prior to the last move and can undo additonal moves from
	   there.  If you remove all but one of the checkers from the board, you've won and get a message
	   letting you know that the game has been won.</p>
	<p>This game of Pyramid is based on a game idea created by Clinton Pasfield, March 1994.  The game code
       was published in the Delphi SWAG.  The game idea base on the code was then reimagined in C# .net.</p>
    <div style="font-weight:bold;">Game Options:</div>
    <p>There are only a couple of options that are controlled by the user.  You can select the color of
	   the checker used and the color of the pyramid board square.  You can also reset the configuration
	   to the defaults which are black checkers and red squares.</p>
	<ul>
        <li>Checker color - select from 8 colors for the checker.  Default is Black.
        <li>Pyramid board square color - select color wanted.  Default is Red.
    </ul>
