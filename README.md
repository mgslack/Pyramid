# Pyramid
Simple game to remove all but one checker from a pyramid shaped board

Game is based on a game idea published in the Delphi SWAG archive by Clinton Pasfield, March 1994.  Reimagined into C#
using same core game idea and rules.

Game is dependant on the GameStatistics and CheckersImages assemblies.  Both must be present to update/compile game.
Created and last updated/compiled using VS 2019.
